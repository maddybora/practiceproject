# Step 1: Data Preparation
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsrscientist/dataset3/main/glass.csv"
glass_data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Step 2: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
# No missing values or outliers, so no preprocessing required.

# Splitting into features and target variable
features = glass_data.drop('Type', axis=1)
target = glass_data['Type']

# Step 3: Feature Selection and Engineering
# No specific feature selection or engineering in this example.

# Step 4: Data Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Model Selection and Training
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Step 7: Model Deployment
# You can deploy the model for future use as per your requirement.
